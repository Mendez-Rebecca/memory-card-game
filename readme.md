# Memory Card Game

This memory card game is intended to test the player's memory by matching like image pairs. Upon starting the game the user will have 30 seconds to review the displayed cards. Once the countdown timer expires the images will flip over. A user's guess is limited to two clicks. If the cards match, the displayed images will remain shown. Should the cards not match, the displayed images will flip back over. Once the player matches up all the pairs successfully there will be an option to reset the game and play again.
